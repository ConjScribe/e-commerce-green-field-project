## About
E-commerce is a full-stack MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular.js, Node.js) website that allows users to sign up for an account and browse   items to their account.

## Summary

> On the frontend, a custom Angular.js component service allows the e-commerce controller to make AJAX requests to the website's API endpoints. The website uses Angular's $routeProvider to serve partial html views according to defined URL routes, and ngRepeat is used to render maketing items. ngShow provides a simple method of conditionally showing/hiding elements in the navbar depending on whether there to the authentication issues and what allow to all users and what allowed to authorized ones.

A normalized data structure with two separate MongoDB collections are used to store User accounts (username with password ) and items. Each item  stores a reference to the User ID that the item belongs to. A MongoDB search on the items collection, by user ID, ensures that each user only sees addes item they own.

authentiction process is used to authenticate users and create a session after login, and the attaches req.user when a user is logged into a session. req.user is attached to the window object as window.user to allow Angular.js to conditionally show/hide elements, like a Logout link, if the user is logged in.
